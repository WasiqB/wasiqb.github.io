## Welcome to my site üëã

I am **Wasiq Amjad Bhamla**, based in Mumbai, Maharashtra, India, a Lead Quality Engineer at [Xnsio][org], also an active open source contributor on [GitHub][github] where I have created some useful test automation frameworks. I also like mentoring people who are as eager to learn as I am.

My overall experience in testing field is more than 15 and half years. My experience started with testing desktop based application for capital market domain, then progressed to testing Web applications, API's (Soap and Rest), Android and iOS native and Hybrid apps.

Being lazy by nature, I tend to automate everything which I need to do manually. This thinking keeps me motivated to learn new testing tools, new technologies and best practices. I keep challenging myself to push my limits and move out of my comfort zone and upgrade my skills.

I like writing about testing and have written few blogs for [LambdaTest blogs][lambda-test] about test automation. I also write on [Medium][medium] and [Hashnode][hashnode]. Also there are some of my old blogs hosted [on this site][blog].

One area where I have not yet stepped on is speaking in conferences, YouTubing and podcasts. This areas I am planning to explore soon. Will definitely post about it as soon as there is some progress.

To keep things short, if you want to know more about me professionally then connect with me [LinkedIn][linkedin] or follow me on [Twitter][twitter].

## My work

There are many libraries and test frameworks which I have created and open sourced, same you can also use in any of your projects with minimal on-boarding time. All my works, with it's documentation can be found on my [GitHub][github]. Feel free to check it out and give a ‚≠ê to the one you like.

I am open to feedbacks, so you are welcome to use any of my project and share your feedbacks on **how good it was** or **how it can be improved** by messaging me here on this site.

## Need my help?

If you feel I can help you in any way then feel free to connect with me here on this site via chat window. Just drop me a message from the chat window, if I am not available, then I will revert back to you on your provided E-mail.

**Please Note:** Since I have some bitter experience in past where people / organizations reach out for help / freelancing opportunity, promising some fees to me but never returned after receiving my services, so now I have started charging some portion as advance fees before starting the work. Fees can be finalized during our first discussion.
