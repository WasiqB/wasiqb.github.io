# Welcome to my home!

Hello everyone! I am Test Automation specialist having more than 12 years of experience in the field. I am passionate about learning new technologies and Automation tools which I try to use and improve Automation. I have done Automation for Windows Desktop apps, Soap / Rest API's, Web apps and Mobile based apps.

I aim to create complete Automation framework suite which will be independent to each other and which will cover different areas of Automation and application types and which will help testers to write scalable and maintainable test scripts. Those framework will be open sourced and will be hosted on GitHub.

Although I have already open sourced some of the frameworks on GitHub which you can checkout on my [GitHub profile][github]. Also you can check out the same in the [Projects section][project]. Other projects will be released soon...

There are so many testers globally who face problems in Automation. I like solving problems faced by them on StackOverflow. It is also rewarding for me as well, as whenever I solve your queries, I get rewarded with some reputation points which encourages me even more. You can checkout my **700++** reputation profile on [StackOverflow][so].

There are so many tools and practices which I use in Automation that I will be gradually sharing in some useful posts about the same. I will be posting the same here on this site which anyone can refer to know how to use them and when to use them. To post all of them will be time consuming but whenever I do, you can find the same in [Blog section][blog]. So stay tuned...
